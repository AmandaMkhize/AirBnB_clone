AirBnB Clone Project README
1) Description of the Project:
We are embarking on a project to create an AirBnB clone. Our primary objective is to develop a command interpreter in Python, which will serve as the foundation for managing AirBnB objects such as users, states, cities, places, and more. This initial phase lays the groundwork for building a comprehensive web application, encompassing HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

2) Description of the Command Interpreter:
Our command interpreter is crafted using Python's cmd module, providing users with a straightforward command-line interface to interact with AirBnB objects. It empowers users to effortlessly create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as perform diverse operations like counting and computing statistics.

3) How to Start It:
To kickstart the command interpreter, we will follow these steps:

Clone our project repository from GitHub.
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Execute the main Python script console.py.

4) How to Use It:
Once the command interpreter is up and running, we will utilize the following commands:

create <classname>: Create a new instance of the specified class.
show <classname> <id>: Display details of the object with the provided ID.
update <classname> <id> <attribute> <value>: Modify the specified attribute of the object with the given ID.
destroy <classname> <id>: Delete the object identified by the provided ID.
all <classname>: Show details of all objects belonging to the specified class.
count <classname>: Calculate the number of objects associated with the specified class.
quit or EOF: Exit the command interpreter.

5) Examples:
Here are a few examples showcasing how to utilize the command interpreter:

"create User"
 "show Place abc"
"update City xyz name "Capetown"
"destroy State 123"

These examples illustrate the diverse operations available within the command interpreter for efficient management of our AirBnB objects.
